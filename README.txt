Assignment 3:  Behavior arises from the level of one's 
consciousness.

About the project.
The focus on this Assignment is to create 3 different agents that create a more emergence when they intract and 
agents need to be run on behaviour trees. Meaning I need to make 3 agents with working behaviour trees.
I have made A, B, C agents. The names of the agents is CollectorTriangle, DistractorCirlce, GuardianRectangle.
The CollectorTriangle collects black sqaures that increases the score and can take the orange sqaure power up to increase speed.
CollectorTriangle avoids the distractor.
DistractorCircle trying to stop the collectorTriangle and avoids the guardian and can take the orange sqaure for power up,
that teleports the guardian to farthest corner of the distractor.
The GuardianRectangle is partoling the black sqaure to make so DistractorCircle dont disturb the CollectorTriangle.
Guardian take chase on Distractor if it to close to the CollectorTriangle and it can collect the orange sqaure to increase size.
